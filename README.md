## üìÑ Abstract

This paper presents the design and analysis of the Gilbert Cell Mixer using IHP SG13G2 technology.  
The proposed mixer provides **high gain performance** and **good linearity**.  
DC, Transient, and AC analyses were performed to evaluate key performance parameters.  
The mixer achieves a **conversion gain of approximately 2.5 dB** with an **operating frequency of 2 GHz**.
